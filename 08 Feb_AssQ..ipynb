    "        1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and behavior within a single\n",
    "          unit or object. In OOP, this is achieved by defining classes and objects that encapsulate\n",
    "          the data and behavior of the system. By using classes and objects, you can hide the \n",

    "          be thought of as a blueprint for creating concrete data structures that implement the ADT's behavior.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3.Interfaces: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods or attributes that must be\n",
    "          implemented by any class that implements the interface. Interfaces can be used to define a common\n",
    "          interface or protocol for a group of related objects, so that they can be treated interchangeably\n",

Instead, concrete subclasses must be created that inherit from the abstract class and provide a complete implementation of the methods and attributes defined by the abstract class."
